plugin for CudaText.
it sync's vertical and/or horizontal scrolling for active files in groups 1 and 2.
it gives 2 commands: "Sync vertical scroll", "Sync horizontal scroll".
it is function from Notepad++ and SynWrite editors.

plugins needs that group-mode "2 horz" or "2 vert" is active.
on changing group-mode to others, plugin deactivates.
plugin subscribes to editor event dinamically, so it don't slow down editor, if not active.
